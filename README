T3s

T3s is a game that I've developed in 2020, during a pandemic lockdown. It's a remake of Tetris developed 
for Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES). The game was made in Gamemaker Studio. The original GameMaker 
source files are available in the "T3s" folder and are dedicated to the public domain.
