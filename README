T3s

T3s is a game that I've designed and developed in 2020, during a pandemic lockdown. It's a remake of Tetris 
developed for Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES). The game was made in Gamemaker Studio. The original 
GameMaker source files are available in the "T3s" folder and are dedicated to the public domain under a 
Creative Commons CC0 1.0 license, for the educational or personal purposes only.

Also, there's an AAB file that you can install on Android-based device and try the game.
